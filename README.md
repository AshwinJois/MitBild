Hello everyone, I have explained briefly my approach in making a GUI and I have named it as “MitBild” which deals with computer vision applications.  

How can I create a GUI?

We can create a GUI of our own by making use of Tkinter or by using PyQt library. Here, I have used PyQt library as I felt it was much more easier than Tkinter. You will need to download Qt Designer first, once the download is completed you can start designing how you want your GUI to look like. Check https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html and https://dev.to/amigosmaker/python-gui-pyqt-vs-tkinter-5hdd for detailed information.

Just a GUI? 

We all know GUI is a tool which varies from a simple Calculator to Google Chrome and much more. Now it’s left to us how we want our GUI to function. Shall we make a GUI which deals with Images? Seems fine, let’s get started.
This GUI will deal with image and basic operations on the image such as rotate right, left and flip with the help of buttons. Whenever a button is clicked, some operation should be performed on the image and it should be displayed.

How to operate with Image?

Just to make our lives simpler, Intel has developed OpenCV library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision applications. We will be using a lot of OpenCV functions in the development of this tool. To get detailed information check  https://opencv.org/.

How does the tool look like? Follow the steps below.

Important: From the repository download MitBild.py and Help.py, make sure that both are in the same folder. 
Step1: 
Run MitBild.py and a new window opens which looks like this
